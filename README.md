# CellTypePrediction
In this study, we explore using machine learning methodologies to predict T-cell types utilizing new T-cell receptor (TCR) repertoire sequencing data from UCSF. The prediction models were developed by employing advanced algorithms such as XGBoost and Random Forest for classification, and Kmeans, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, DBSCAN, and Gaussian Mixture models for clustering. The study was carried out using a comprehensive dataset that comprised 18,465 samples. Our models demonstrated high accuracy in cell-type prediction, underscoring the power of these machine learning approaches. This research illuminates the potential for these advanced machine learning techniques to contribute significantly to the field of cellular biology by providing accurate predictions of cell types. These insights into the T-cell repertoire and its correlation with immune response could enhance our understanding of T-cell functionalities and have implications for disease diagnosis and therapeutic strategies.
